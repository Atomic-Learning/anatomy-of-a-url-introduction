<p>A url (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used to access resources on the internet. It can have several components, each conveying different information. For example, consider the following url:</p>

<p>https://www.example.com/about-us</p>

<p>Here's a breakdown of its components:</p>

<h2>1. Protocol</h2>
<p>The protocol indicates how data is transferred between your browser and the web server. In this case, <strong>https://</strong> stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure, which means the connection is encrypted for security.</p>

<h2>2. Subdomain</h2>
<p>The subdomain is an optional part of the url that precedes the main domain name. In this example, <strong>www.</strong> is the subdomain, which is commonly used to denote the World Wide Web. Not all websites use a subdomain.</p>

<h2>3. Domain Name</h2>
<p>The domain name is the main part of the url that identifies the website. In this case, <strong>example.com</strong> is the domain name. It consists of two parts: the second-level domain (example) and the top-level domain (.com).</p>

<h2>4. Path</h2>
<p>The path specifies the exact location of a resource on the server. In this example, <strong>/about-us</strong> indicates that the user is accessing the "About Us" page of the website. The readable part of the path (<strong>about-us</strong>) is often called a "slug"—a URL-friendly version of the page name.</p>
